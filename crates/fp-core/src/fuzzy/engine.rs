//! Stage-two probabilistic scoring, decision, and drift (fuzzy-matching §5/§6/§7/§8).
//!
//! Given a probe, [`FuzzyStore::identify`] performs the full two-stage match:
//! stage one recalls candidates from the blocking indexes (fuzzy-matching §4, in
//! [`super`]), stage two scores each candidate with the Fellegi–Sunter model
//! (§5) and applies the double-threshold decision (§5.4), drift update (§7), and
//! confidence fusion (§6).
//!
//! The Fellegi–Sunter weights use two per-component parameters:
//! - `m_i = P(agree | same device)` — the cold-start stability prior (§2/§9),
//!   read from [`super::classify`].
//! - `u_i = P(agree | different device)` — the value's rarity, estimated from
//!   the frequency table (§9). Rare values that agree are strong evidence;
//!   common ones (Chrome-on-Windows) carry almost none.
//!
//! Thresholds and priors here are **cold-start defaults**; the fuzzy-matching spec's offline
//! evaluation (§10) tunes them against a labelled set. They are deliberately
//! separated so the eval harness can grid-search without touching scoring.
