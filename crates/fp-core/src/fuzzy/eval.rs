//! Offline evaluation harness for the matching engine (design §10).
//!
//! The design gates the PRD §3 targets (stability ≥ 95 %, collision ≤ 1 %)
//! behind an offline evaluation against a **labelled** set: observations tagged
//! with a ground-truth `deviceId` (login state / long-lived cookie). This module
//! defines that fixture format, replays it through [`FuzzyStore::identify`], and
//! reports the two headline metrics:
//!
//! - **stability rate** — of all same-device revisits, the fraction re-resolved
//!   to that device's own `visitorId` (design §10 稳定率).
//! - **collision rate** — of all observations, the fraction merged onto a
//!   `visitorId` first minted by a *different* ground-truth device (碰撞率).
//!
//! The bundled [`synthetic`] fixture is hand-authored to exercise the engine
//! **directionally** — same-device visits drift only slightly (a browser
//! upgrade, one font swap) while distinct devices disagree on every
//! high-stability discriminant. It is a smoke test for the scoring wiring, not
//! evidence for the numeric targets.
//!
//! TODO(real-data): replace [`synthetic`] with a real labelled corpus (design
//! §10 ground truth) and grid-search `T_lo / T_hi / τ` and the component priors
//! before claiming the PRD §3 95 %/1 % numbers. The rates this harness prints on
//! synthetic input MUST NOT be reported as the production stability/collision
//! figures.
