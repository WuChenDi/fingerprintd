/**
 * STUBBED host state (PCF3).
 *
 * The edge architecture externalizes all request state the native server keeps
 * in-process: the one-time nonce belongs in a Durable Object (atomic
 * check-and-burn), and the fingerprint / blocking index belongs in D1. Those
 * are wired in PCF4. This module provides in-isolate stand-ins with the SAME
 * async interfaces the DO/D1 adapters will implement, so PCF4 is a drop-in swap
 * and the router in `handler.ts` never changes.
 *
 * WHY THESE ARE STUBS, NOT PRODUCTION: a Worker isolate is ephemeral and not
 * shared, so an in-memory `Map` nonce store neither survives isolate recycling
 * nor coordinates across isolates — a nonce issued by one isolate is unknown to
 * the next, and burns do not replicate. It is correct only for single-isolate
 * local `wrangler dev` / tests. The candidate source always recalls nothing, so
 * every `/identify` resolves to a new device. Both are replaced in PCF4.
