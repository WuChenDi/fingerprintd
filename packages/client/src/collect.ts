/**
 * Collection contract. A `Collector` turns a challenge into the client-observed
 * evidence the server will judge. TC2/TC3/TC5 plug concrete collectors in here
 * (canvas/audio/webgl, stable components, nonce-probe computation); this module
 * ships only the interface plus a trivial stub.
 *
 * DESIGN: the client only COLLECTS — it never derives a visitorId or hash and
 * never mixes the nonce into the stable components. `stable_components` and the
 * `probe` stay SEPARATE: the latter is a freshness proof, never a matching
 * signal.
 *
 * ENVIRONMENT LIMIT: there is no headless browser in this environment, so real
 * canvas/audio/webgl collection cannot be exercised. The stub below returns
 * empty evidence; real collectors are validated by a human in a real browser.
