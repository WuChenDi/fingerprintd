/**
 * Typed host wrapper around the WASM compute engine (`crates/fp-wasm`).
 *
 * The `FpEngine` WASM class is the SINGLE source of the fingerprinting compute,
 * shared with the native Axum server via `fp-core`: blocking-key derivation,
 * Fellegi–Sunter scoring, probe verification, and response signing. This module
 * owns the wasm-bindgen module lifecycle (a one-time `initSync`) and marshals
 * the JSON string boundary so the router in `handler.ts` deals in typed values.
 *
 * The engine holds NO request state: `score` rebuilds the host-recalled candidate
 * block in a transient store per call and discards it. All persistence (nonce
 * burn, candidate recall, drift write-back) is the host's, so this stays pure.
