 * The windowed fan-out aggregates (`device_account_fanout`, `ip_account_count`)
 * are load-bearing but expensive: computing them from D1 means a `COUNT(DISTINCT)`
 * scan on every check-in. For the hottest entities — a device farm's shared
 * device, a proxy's shared IP — that scan repeats thousands of times a minute.
 * A Durable Object gives the edge primitive D1 cannot: a single-threaded
 * instance whose storage is serialized, so a distinct-member velocity count can
 * be maintained incrementally and read atomically without touching the table.
 *
 * ONE INSTANCE PER ENTITY: the host addresses the DO by `idFromName(scopeKey)`
 * (e.g. `v:<visitorId>` or `ip:<ip>`), so each entity's rolling window lives in
 * its own instance. Each `bump` records the member (the counterpart id) with an
 * expiry, prunes lapsed members, and returns the live distinct count. An alarm
 * at the furthest expiry evicts a fully-lapsed instance so storage does not leak.
