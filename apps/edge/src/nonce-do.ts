/**
 * The one-time nonce store as a Durable Object.
 *
 * The native server keeps nonces in an in-process map with atomic check-and-burn
 * (`fp_core::nonce`). A Worker isolate cannot: it is ephemeral and unshared, and
 * D1 (or KV) replicates eventually with no atomic compare-and-delete, so a
 * replayed nonce could be accepted twice in the window between read and delete.
 * A Durable Object is the one edge primitive with the needed guarantee — a
 * single-threaded instance whose storage operations are serialized — so the
 * get-then-burn in {@link NonceDurableObject.consume} cannot interleave with a
 * concurrent replay of the same nonce.
 *
 * ONE INSTANCE PER NONCE: the host addresses the DO by `idFromName(nonce)`, so
 * each nonce's lifecycle lives in its own instance holding a single record. An
 * alarm set to the expiry burns an un-consumed nonce so storage does not leak.
