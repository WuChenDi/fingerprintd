# prepare.sh — runs during `bun install` (the repo-root `prepare` lifecycle).
# Builds the workspace packages (the SDK) so a fresh install yields a
# ready-to-consume @cdlab/fingerprintd-client.
#
# The SDK imports the vendored WASM under packages/client/wasm, which is a BUILD
# ARTIFACT and NOT committed. When it is missing (fresh clone / after clean):
#   - if a Rust toolchain + wasm-pack are available, build it automatically so a
#     single `bun install` sets everything up;
#   - otherwise skip with a hint, so a JS-only install still succeeds.
# Either way `bun install` must NEVER hard-fail: the auto-build is best-effort —
# a failed WASM build warns and skips the SDK prebuild rather than aborting.
#
# Note: this only fires when the WASM dir is ABSENT, so a normal install (WASM
# already built) never recompiles Rust. In CI/deploy the WASM is materialised
# before install, so this path is not taken there.
